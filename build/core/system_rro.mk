## Standard rules for installing runtime resouce overlay APKs.
##
## Set LOCAL_RRO_THEME to the theme name if the package should apply only to
## a particular theme as set by ro.boot.vendor.overlay.theme system property.
##
##Â If LOCAL_RRO_THEME is not set, the package will apply always, independent
## of themes.
