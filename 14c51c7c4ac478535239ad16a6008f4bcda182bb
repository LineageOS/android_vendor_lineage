      "message": "This was introduced primarily for begonia (and for potentially other recent MediaTek devices); The dtbo image has 2 certs appended to it. Without it, the bootloader does not continue and reboots the device even before logo loads. The rules were slightly modified to run a python script for aligning and appending the certs correctly.
