    Normally, restoring from backup is only available during initial device setup.
    You can make it always available at your own risk.
    Keep in mind that the Auto-Restore feature works independently from this.

    Launch an intent with the action "com.stevesoltys.seedvault.RESTORE_BACKUP"
    to trigger restore during device setup.
