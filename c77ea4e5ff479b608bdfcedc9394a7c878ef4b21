      "message": "Something is screwy with syntax here. The if condition is ALWAYS returning true, regardless if the find gets anything or not. Which means that ps1 always hit the exit 1 and failed. PS2 works around this by echoing back to a var during the loop and checking if that is non-empty. However, if I remove the if and just run the loop, the exit conditional there always returns true and fails all builds. I have no idea what\u0027s going on, but this patchset does list all dups, then only exits on a real failure. As ugly and technically redundant as the flow is.",
