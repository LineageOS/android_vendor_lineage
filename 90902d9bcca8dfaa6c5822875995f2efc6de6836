Is it something we have control over (IOW, build from source), or is it some QCOM blob running under the telephony service UID?\n\nI think its related to this, not sure though. it was merged in May SP .\nhttps://github.com/LineageOS/android_frameworks_base/commit/abb41637225c95d5530bff275531a446be66a18c",

That patch just removes location info from the service state broadcast for receivers not holding the location permission, it doesn\u0027t change anything regarding location requests.\n\nAfter reverting the commit in question, I have gotten zero location requests from Phone Services.",
