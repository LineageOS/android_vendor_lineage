Qualcomm got rid of their kernel build task. It\u0027s a massive PITA to compile inline now with the way they set up 5.10.\n\nIMHO for GKI devices like raviole, we should not build inline. Instead, we should just build the kernel externally and use a prebuilt kernel from there.\n\nWe could just run a script to build the kernel in the build system, and then use a \"prebuilt\" from the freshly built kernel.\n\nWanting to build the kernel inline is holding us back. Other ROMs like ProtonAOSP and GrapheneOS already have Pixel 6 support since they don\u0027t need inline kernel building like us, they just use GKI like the Pixel 6 stock.\n\nWhat worked in the past may not work now. What worked for a Nexus 6P or even a Pixel 5 won\u0027t work for a Pixel 6.",

That won\u0027t fly.\n\nTired of people saying \"jUst UsE PreBuilT\" when it\u0027s not a simple switch to flip.\n\nUnless you\u0027re pitching just using the google provided prebuilts. That could work fine, but there are definitely things we\u0027d change if we were building from source - e.g. DirtyPipe which took Google way longer to patch than it should\u0027ve.\n\nLet\u0027s look past all that and say, \"use prebuilt Google kernels and deal with it\" - sure - now figure out where to host the Camera APEX (critical to camera functionality) in a sustainable manner. Only thing I\u0027ve seen proposed that would work is to extract said APEX and drop stuff on relevant partitions - and yet no one has done such.",
